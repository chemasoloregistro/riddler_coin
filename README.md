# riddler_coin

This is supposed to be a response to The Riddler question 160715.

Simulates a coin flipped up to 100 times to reach Trues - Falses = goal. Assumes x = y, for goals
from 2 to 10. Estimated number of flips x + 2n, being n the expected number of two different consecutive flips
Simulation repeated 1,000,000 times, then Pmf estimated and printed.

Used thinkbayes by Allen Downey for Pmf calculation and plot
